ECE 459 A1 Backend
==================

This is a tiny python script to return parts of an image (requires pillow, tornado).
It simulates some service that does computation and returns after some time.
Instead of computing, the script just waits abs(random.gauss(0.2, 0.2))
seconds and then returns the image.
